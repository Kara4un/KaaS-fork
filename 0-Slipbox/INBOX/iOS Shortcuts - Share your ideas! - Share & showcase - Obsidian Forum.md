It requires Toolbox Pro, and you’ll need to bookmark the icloud folder your vault is in. To do this, go to Toolbox Pro->Settings->Folder bookmarks->The “+” sign in the upper-right-hand corner. Then, in the shortcut itself, change the file path in the Toolbox Pro block so that it matches your folder. This gets around the sandboxing issues with the shortcuts app.
