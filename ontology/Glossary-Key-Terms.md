# Glossary Key Terms

This glossary provides standardized terminology for engineering and operations.

## A

- **ADR**: Architecture Decision Record documenting a technical decision and its trade-offs.
- **API Contract**: formal agreement for interface behavior, payloads, and error semantics.

## C

- **Change Failure Rate**: percentage of deployments causing degradation or incident.
- **Control Plane**: management layer responsible for orchestration and policy decisions.

## D

- **Data Contract**: explicit schema and quality agreement between data producer and consumer.
- **Definition of Done**: checklist that must be met before work is complete.

## I

- **Incident**: unplanned interruption or degradation of a service.
- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**: provisioning and management of infrastructure through versioned code.

## O

- **[[Observability]]**: ability to infer system state from telemetry (logs, metrics, traces).
- **Operational Readiness**: state in which a service is deployable and supportable in production.

## R

- **RPO (Recovery Point Objective)**: maximum acceptable data loss window.
- **RTO (Recovery Time Objective)**: maximum acceptable service restoration time.

## S

- **SLA**: external commitment level for service availability or performance.
- **SLO**: internal reliability target used to manage service health.
- **SLI**: measurable indicator used to evaluate SLO attainment.

## T

- **Technical Debt**: deferred engineering work that increases future change cost or risk.
- **Threat Model**: structured analysis of potential attack vectors and mitigations.

## V

- **Value Stream**: end-to-end flow from idea to production value delivery.

## Usage Rules

- Reuse these terms verbatim in standards, ADRs, and runbooks.
- Prefer linking to glossary definitions rather than redefining terms per note.
- If adding a new term, include definition, context, and practical scope.
