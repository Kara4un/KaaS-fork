## Highlights

* Make the shell script executable. To do that you type the following in the terminal: chmod +x \<\<the-correct-filename.sh>>. This is the unix way to make a shell script "executable". I'm not confident I fully understand what that means, other than it's needed to make any shell scripts you write executable, so don't ask me and I won't lie to you
