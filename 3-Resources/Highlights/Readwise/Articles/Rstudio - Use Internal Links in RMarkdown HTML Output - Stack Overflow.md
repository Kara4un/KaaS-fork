## Metadata

* Author: 
* Full Title: Rstudio - Use Internal Links in RMarkdown HTML Output - Stack Overflow
* Category: #Type/Highlight/Article
* URL: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/39281266/use-internal-links-in-rmarkdown-html-output

## Highlights

* Pandoc supports explicit and implicit section references for headers; see the pandoc manual.
  explicit: you give a custom name to a header ## Test {#test} and later refer to it with a link syntax: see [the relevant section](#test).
  implicit: headers where you don't set a custom name, like ## Test, can still be refered to: See the section called \[Test\].
