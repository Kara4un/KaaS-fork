# Auto Documentation System for R Shiny - Stack Overflow

## Metadata

* Author: 
* Full Title: Auto Documentation System for R Shiny - Stack Overflow
* Category: #Type/Highlight/Article
* URL: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/53373290/auto-documentation-system-for-r-shiny

## Highlights

* update 1: I have tried ShinyTester which reads through source code and try to predict a network of sub-element interactions. It did not handle sourcing of external files, but with a little debug I manage to get the below diagram. Unfortunately, only 5% of elements and interactions were discovered hereby. Maybe ShinyTester could need some contributions
