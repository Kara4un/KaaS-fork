## Highlights

* Automation is a great way to help you stay organized in Windows, and DropIt practically gives you a virtual helper at your fingertips.
* If you’re the kind of person who arranges your smartphone apps by color, you’re going to love TileIconifier. Though it’s going to demand a bit of your time if you’re crazy about how your Start Menu looks, this utility allows you to customize your apps’ tiles.
* You can make both light and dark versions of the icon, too, in case you ever feel like switching Windows themes.
