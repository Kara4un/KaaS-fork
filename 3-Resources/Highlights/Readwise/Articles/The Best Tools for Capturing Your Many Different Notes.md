# The Best Tools for Capturing Your Many Different Notes

## Metadata

* Author: *Anna Burgess Yang*

## Highlights

* Keeping a simple list of who/what/where means I write down events that seem mundane at the time, but later on help paint a better portrait of the day, or even become more significant over time. By “sticking to the facts” I don’t pre-judge what was important or what wasn’t, I just write it down.
