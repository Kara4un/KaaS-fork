# Clean Up and Declutter Your Computer

## Metadata

* Author: *Febé Meyer*
* Full Title: Clean Up and Declutter Your Computer
* Category: #Type/Highlight/Book

## Highlights

* Keep a temporary folder for your email (this works just like the temporary folder for your documents). This is especially important for emails, since a majority are usually valid only for a while. Keep an archive folder as well for old folders that aren’t used anymore, but contain important information. Make sure to delete irrelevant mail before you archive it.
