## Highlights

* How should I organize my file structure when creating a new project? Should I do data cleaning in an RMarkdown file or an R script file? How do I find packages? How do I know if the packages I find are high quality?
* The targets package is a Make-like pipeline toolkit for Statistics and data science in R. With targets, you can maintain a reproducible workflow without repeating yourself. targets learns how your pipeline fits together, skips costly runtime for tasks that are already up to date, runs only the necessary computation, supports implicit parallel computing, abstracts files as R objects, and shows tangible evidence that the results match the underlying code and data.
